  title: MATRUVA Backend API
  description: |
    REST API for MATRUVA platform with JWT-based authentication, RBAC, and admin management.

    ## Authentication
    This API uses RS256 JWT tokens for authentication:
    - **Access Token**: Short-lived (15 min), used for API requests
    - **Refresh Token**: Long-lived (30 days), httpOnly cookie for token rotation

    ## Authorization
    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with three default roles:
    - `USER`: Regular users
    - `ADMIN`: System administrators
    - `SUPER_ADMIN`: Full system access

    ## Security
    - All admin endpoints require authentication
    - CSRF protection on token refresh via X-Auth-Refresh header
    - Refresh token rotation on every use
    - Session tracking with IP and User-Agent
  version: 1.0.0
